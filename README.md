## üöÄ The Mission

Recycling rules can be confusing, varying from one place to another and changing over time. This confusion often leads to "wish-cycling"‚Äîtossing items in the recycling bin hoping they're recyclable, which can contaminate entire batches of materials.

RecycleWise Lens tackles this problem head-on by providing **clarity and confidence** in waste disposal. Our goal is to empower users to make correct recycling choices, reduce landfill waste, and contribute to a healthier planet.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üß† AI-Powered Item Recognition:** Uses Google's Gemini model to accurately identify waste items from an image.
*   **üìù Instant Disposal Instructions:** Provides clear, step-by-step guidance on whether an item should be recycled, composted, or sent to a landfill.
*   **üí° Creative DIY & Reuse Ideas:** Inspires users to reduce waste by offering creative ways to repurpose items instead of throwing them away.
*   **üìà Personal Impact Dashboard:** Visualizes your recycling efforts over time, showing you the tangible impact of your habits.
*   **‚úçÔ∏è User Feedback Loop:** An intuitive thumbs-up/down system helps refine the AI's accuracy over time.
*   **üìú Scan History:** Keeps a log of everything you've scanned, allowing you to review past results.

## üå± How It Creates Impact

RecycleWise Lens is more than just a utility; it's an educational tool that fosters environmental stewardship.

*   **Reduces Contamination:** By helping users make correct choices, we improve the quality of recycling streams.
*   **Diverts Waste from Landfills:** Every item correctly recycled or composted is one less item in a landfill.
*   **Promotes a Circular Economy:** The app encourages users to think about the entire lifecycle of a product by suggesting creative reuse ideas.
*   **Builds Sustainable Habits:** The Impact Dashboard provides positive reinforcement, motivating users to continue making mindful choices.

## üîÆ Future Scope

This project has a strong foundation with exciting potential for growth:

*   **Hyper-Local Recycling Rules:** Integrate with municipal APIs to provide disposal rules specific to a user's exact location.
*   **Gamification & Community Challenges:** Add points, badges, and leaderboards to make recycling a fun, competitive, and social activity.
*   **Barcode Scanning:** Allow users to scan barcodes for precise product identification and even more accurate disposal information.
*   **Educational Content Hub:** Build a library of articles and videos about recycling, composting, and sustainable living.
*   **Enterprise Solutions:** Partner with businesses and municipalities to help them improve their waste management programs.
